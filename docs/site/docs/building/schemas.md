# Schemas

## Schema validation

An endpoint directory may optionally contain a `_schema.json`: an **OpenAPI 3.1
operation object** describing the request and response bodies. Only two paths
inside it are read — everything else in the object is ignored:

- `requestBody.content['application/json'].schema`
- `responses.<key>.content['application/json'].schema`

Each `schema` is a plain **JSON Schema (2020-12)** object. Without a `_schema.json`
file, no validation of any kind happens for that endpoint — request bodies,
generated responses, and `real` responses all pass through unchecked, exactly as
before this feature existed.

`catalog/hello-system/hello_world/_schema.json`

```json
{
  "requestBody": {
    "required": true,
    "content": {
      "application/json": {
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["customerId"],
          "properties": {
            "customerId": { "type": "string" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "responses": {
    "200": {
      "content": {
        "application/json": {
          "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "required": ["customerId", "status", "message"],
            "properties": {
              "customerId": { "type": "string" },
              "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["success"] },
              "message": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "5XX": {
      "content": {
        "application/json": {
          "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "required": ["status", "message"],
            "properties": {
              "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["failure"] },
              "message": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This `hello_world` schema requires a `customerId` string in the request, a `200`
response shaped like `default.json` (`customerId` / `status: "success"` /
`message`), and any `5xx` response shaped like `failure.json`
(`status: "failure"` / `message`).

**Response-status matching.** A response body is checked against the `responses`
entry chosen by its status, in this order: an exact key (`"200"`), then a range
key (`"2XX"`, `"5XX"`, …), then `"default"`. A status that matches none of them is
a validation error.

| When | What's checked | On mismatch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup | Every scenario fixture's `body` against the response schema matched by its `status`. | Joins the catalog's startup error list — same as a structural or semantic validation error. |
| Startup | Every body placeholder against `requestBody`: a `{{$.…}}` selector over a field the request schema lets a caller **omit**, with no `default`/`omit` fallback. | Startup error — see [Optional fields must have a fallback](#optional-fields-must-have-a-fallback) below. |
| Runtime — mocked scenario | The incoming request body against `requestBody`; after placeholder resolution, the generated response body against the status-matched response schema. | Request: `400` with an `error` and a `details` array. Response: `500` with the same shape. |
| Runtime — `real` passthrough | The proxied response body, when its `content-type` is JSON, against the status-matched response schema. Requests are never validated for `real`. | Never blocks or alters the response — a mismatch is recorded as `drift_warning` in the decision trace and logs at console `warn` level. |

!!! note "Fixture bodies vs. live request/response bodies"

    At startup, string values in a fixture's `body` that contain a `{{…}}`
    placeholder are treated as wildcards — the field's presence and position are
    still checked, but its unresolved placeholder text isn't type-checked against
    the schema. At runtime, bodies are validated *after* placeholders have been
    resolved to real values, so the full schema applies.

!!! warning "`requestBody.required`"

    Setting `requestBody.required: true` makes a missing request body itself a
    `400`, even before the schema would otherwise have something to check.

!!! warning "A schema that won't compile is a startup error"

    An invalid JSON Schema anywhere in `_schema.json` (request or any response)
    fails catalog validation immediately, alongside fixture-body mismatches — run
    `npm run validate:catalog` after adding or editing one.

### Optional fields must have a fallback

When an endpoint has a request schema, a fixture placeholder that reads a body
field the schema lets a caller **omit** — and supplies no fallback — is a
**startup error**. The schema says the field is optional; the placeholder makes
it de-facto required, because a request without it
[fails with a `500`](fixtures.md#typed-substitution).

```json
// requestBody schema: "id" required, "middleName" optional
{ "type": "object", "required": ["id"],
  "properties": { "id": {}, "middleName": {} } }

// fixture body — the {{$.middleName}} placeholder is the error
{ "id": "{{$.id}}", "middleName": "{{$.middleName}}" }
```

`{{$.id}}` is fine — a request without `id` is already rejected with a `400`
before templating. `{{$.middleName}}` is flagged, with three ways to resolve it:

- `{{$.middleName | omit}}` — [drop the field](fixtures.md#dropping-a-field-when-its-source-is-absent) when the caller omits it
- `{{$.middleName | default:'N/A'}}` — [substitute a value](fixtures.md#fallbacks-for-missing-values)
- add `middleName` to the schema's `required` — if it was never really optional

The check is deliberately conservative: it flags only a field **provably**
optional under plain `object`/`required`/`properties` (following `#/$defs/`
references). Anything it can't decide — a field behind `anyOf`/`allOf`/`if`, an
array element, a `$ref` it can't resolve — is left alone, so it never blocks a
valid catalog. `header:`, `path:`, and `query:` selectors are out of scope: the
request schema describes only the JSON body.

## System-level `_spec` file

Instead of a `_schema.json` per endpoint, a **system** may carry one OpenAPI
document at `catalog/<system>/_spec.yaml` (or `_spec.yml` / `_spec.json`) that
supplies schemas for all of its endpoints. Each endpoint is matched to an
operation by **method + path**: the loader looks up
`paths[<endpoint path>][<endpoint method>]` in the document, using the `method`
and `path` already declared in the endpoint's `_endpoint.json`. Catalog paths
use the same `{param}` templating as OpenAPI (e.g. `/customers/{customerId}`),
so they line up directly.

Only the same two subtrees are read from each matched operation —
`requestBody.content['application/json'].schema` and
`responses.<key>.content['application/json'].schema` — so a `_spec` operation
and a standalone `_schema.json` are interchangeable in what they contribute.

```yaml
# catalog/hello-system/_spec.yaml
paths:
  /hello/world:
    post:
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/HelloRequest' }
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/HelloResponse' }
components:
  schemas:
    HelloRequest:
      type: object
      required: [customerId]
      properties:
        customerId: { type: string }
    HelloResponse:
      type: object
      required: [customerId, status, message]
      properties:
        customerId: { type: string }
        status: { type: string, enum: [success] }
        message: { type: string }
```

**Rules and limits**

- **One schema source per system.** If a system has a `_spec` file, a
  `_schema.json` in any of its endpoint directories is a startup error — choose
  one or the other per system.
- **Unmatched endpoints warn, they don't fail.** An endpoint whose method + path
  has no matching operation gets no schema (no validation, exactly as if it had
  no `_schema.json`) and logs a startup warning. Watch for this if a path
  parameter is named differently in the spec than in the catalog directory —
  `/customers/{customerId}` and `/customers/{id}` do not match.
- **In-document references only.** `$ref`s must point at
  `#/components/schemas/…` within the same file; the loader inlines them into
  each endpoint's schema. External or remote `$ref`s (other files, URLs) are a
  startup error.
- **Not read from the spec.** `servers`, `security`, `info`, and path-level
  `parameters` are ignored — base URLs still come from `_system.json`'s
  `baseUrlEnv`, and the spec never creates endpoints on its own (you still author
  each endpoint directory and its scenarios).

Run `npm run validate:catalog` after adding or editing a `_spec` file — it
reports the same errors as startup and prints any unmatched-endpoint warnings.
